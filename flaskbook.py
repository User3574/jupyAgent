- It has been studied extensively in the fields of mathematics, ecology, and biology.
- The equation is often used to model population growth and decline in various ecosystems.
- It can be solved using various numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method.

### 1.3. Facts to derive

- The equation can be approximated using the finite difference method or the finite element method.
- The solution to the Lotka-Vera equation can be expressed in terms of the population size and the environmental conditions.
- The equation can be used to model the dynamics of populations in various ecosystems, including predator-prey systems and competition for resources.

## Plan
### Step 1: Define the Lotka-Vera equation
The Lotka-Vera equation is a second-order linear differential equation that can be written as:

dy/dt = r*y*(1 - y/K) - m*y^2

where y is the population size, r is the growth rate, K is the carrying capacity, and m is the mortality rate.

### Step 2: Choose a numerical method to solve the equation
The finite difference method can be used to solve the Lotka-Vera equation. This method involves discretizing the spatial and temporal derivatives using finite differences and then solving the resulting system of ordinary differential equations.

### Step 3: Implement the numerical method in Python
Using the finite difference method, we can implement the Lotka-Vera equation in Python as follows:

```
def lotka_vera(y, t, r, K, m):
    dy_dt = r*y*(1 - y/K) - m*y**2
    return dy_dt
```

### Step 4: Solve the equation using the finite difference method
We can use the finite difference method to solve the Lotka-Vera equation using the following code:

```
def solve_lotka_vera(r, K, m, y0, t):
    t_max = 100
    dt = 0.01
    y = y0
    y_values = [y]
    t_values = [t]

    for i in range(int(t_max/dt)):
        dy_dt = lotka_vera(y, t_values[-1], r, K, m)
        y_new = y + dt * dy_dt
        y_values.append(y_new)
        t_values.append(t_values[-1] + dt)

    return y_values, t_values
```

### Step 5: Run the simulation and plot the results
We can run the simulation using the following code:

```
r = 0.5
K = 100
m = 0.02
y0 = 100
t = 0
y_values, t_values = solve_lotka_vera(r, K, m, y0, t)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(t_values, y_values)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Population size')
plt.title('Lotka-Vera equation')
plt.show()
```

### Step 6: Analyze the results and draw conclusions
The results of the simulation can be analyzed to draw conclusions about the Lotka-Vera equation. The solution to the equation can be used to model the dynamics of populations in various ecosystems and to understand the impact of different environmental conditions on population growth and decline.
